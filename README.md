# Telling-Stories-w-Data-Repository
This is my portfolio page for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU for Fall 2021. 

## About Me
My name is Carol (she/her) and I'm a second year graduate student pursuing a Master of Arts Managment degree. I graduated with a Bachelor of Music Education degree in 2019 and spent a year as a substitute teacher in Maryland before coming to Carnegie Mellon University. Being a teacher wasn't for me for the long-term, so I decided I wanted to work as an administrator with an arts organization so I was still involved in music education in some way. I studied voice, so my passion lies wtih performing arts organizations, specifically opera. 

Last year I worked with Pittsburgh Festival Opera as the Development and Education intern, and continued as the Development Assistant over the summer. I also interned with Washington Performing Arts in Washington, DC in summer 2021 in their Advancement department. Currently, I work as the Development Intern at WaterFire Providence where I focus on grant-writing. I've grown to really love and appreciate fundraising work and hope to pursue a career in fundraising after I graduate. Eventually, I would like to work for a foundation or other funding organization and be on the giving side of the grant process. 

## What I hope to learn...
I am hoping to learn a lot about good visual design and implementation. Data is often overlooked by arts organizations, but it is an essential part of their function (and it's necessary in order to recieve grant funding!) Throughout the course, I hope to explore visualizations in a way that allows me to better communicate important information to board members, colleagues, and donors in a meaningful way once I am working in the nonprofit sector. 

I also hope to gain some technical skills using GitHub, Tableau, and other visualization software. Having a base understanding of a lot of different programs will come in handy in the future. 

I'm looking forward to learning the creative and technical side of data visualization, and I hope you enjoy viewing all the things I create along the way!
