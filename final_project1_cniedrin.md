# Final Project Part I

## Project Outline

In thinking about this project, I decided to focus on funding disparities within the nonprofit arts and culture sector. I utilized one of the suggested strategies from the book - asking myself what I wanted to say or show and then turning that into a statement about what I want to convince people - in order to come to the following project proposal:

"I want to convince my audience that foundation funding disparities in the nonprofit arts and culture sector disproportionately affect BIPOC-led and low-income organizations, hindering their ability to serve their communities."

With this in mind, I have the following outline for how I want to convey this story to the audience.

### Hook
- "How much do you think gets donated to nonprofit organizations each year?"
    - Call out statistic with the amount of money donated to philanthropy in 2020 - it's in the billions of dollars.
### Introduction
- What does all that money support? 
    - *Visualization comparing dollar amounts donated to each 501(c)3 designation in 2020, highlighting Arts and Culture*
- Discuss the public view on donations to arts and culture - overwhelmingly positive
    - *Visualization of percentage of people who donated to an arts and cultural organization in the last two years.*
    - *Visualization of percentage of people who believe it is important for tax dollars to go towards the arts.*
### Problem Analysis
- Despite all this, giving isn't equitable for all arts and cultural organizations.
    - Call out statistic with average percentage of foundation giving that goes to BIPOC-led organizations (it's 2%, which is horrible).
- Compare this with the overall amount of money given to arts and cultural orgs by foundations in 2018.
    - *Visualization of total amount given by foundations, amount given by top 25 US foundation, and amount given to BIPOC organizations, given the 2% average.*
- The disparities can be seen across organization type within the arts and cultural sector.
    - *Visualization of BIPOC vs. mainstream top 25 dance, theatre, and museum organization's average surplus/deficit in each group*
- But disparities don't stop at revolving around racial lines; there are also clear disparities in monies awarded based on organizational size and community makeup.
    - *Visualization showing different in funding for large vs. small organizations and how that relates to the percentage of all organizations those budget allocations make up        in the arts and culture ecosystem*
    - *Visualization showing disparities between rural, low-income, and POC demographics compared to amount of grant funding recieved*
- Clearly, foundations aren't prioritizing smaller, more diverse organizations, despite their claims to be invested in more DEAI initiatives and equity-based practices.
### Call to Action
- Foundations need to change their practices to be more equitable and here's what you can do:
    1. Learn more about Community Centric Fundraising, which includes ways for organizations to think about taking, or declining, foundation grants to provide more equity and          better outcomes for smaller, BIPOC-led organizations.
    2. Donate your charitable dollars to local, community arts and culture organizations, rather than to multi-million dollar businesses.
- Together, we can make the arts and cultural sector a more equitable, financially sustainable place for all organizations.
