# Final Project Part I

## Project Outline

In thinking about this project, I decided to focus on funding disparities within the nonprofit arts and culture sector. I utilized one of the suggested strategies from the book - asking myself what I wanted to say or show and then turning that into a statement about what I want to convince people - in order to come to the following project proposal:

*"I want to convince my audience that foundation funding disparities in the nonprofit arts and culture sector disproportionately affect BIPOC-led and low-income organizations, hindering their ability to serve their communities."*

With this in mind, I have the following outline for how I want to convey this story to the audience.

### Hook
- "How much do you think gets donated to nonprofit organizations each year?"
    - Call out statistic with the amount of money donated to philanthropy in 2020 - it's in the billions of dollars.
### Introduction
- Discussion of what all that money supports. 
    - *Visualization comparing dollar amounts donated to each 501(c)3 designation in 2020, highlighting Arts and Culture*
- Discuss the public view on donations to arts and culture - overwhelmingly positive
    - *Visualization of percentage of people who donated to an arts and cultural organization in the last two years.*
    - *Visualization of percentage of people who believe it is important for tax dollars to go towards the arts.*
### Problem Analysis
- Despite all this, giving isn't equitable for all arts and cultural organizations.
    - Call out statistic with average percentage of foundation giving that goes to BIPOC-led organizations (it's 2%, which is horrible).
- Compare this 2% statistic with the overall amount of money given to arts and cultural orgs by foundations in 2018.
    - *Visualization of total amount given by foundations, amount given by top 25 US foundation, and amount given to BIPOC organizations, given the 2% average.*
- Show that disparities can be seen across organization type within the arts and cultural sector.
    - *Visualization of BIPOC vs. mainstream top 25 dance, theatre, and museum organization's average surplus/deficit in each group*
- Expand on disparities by exemplifying that they don't only run along racial lines; there are also clear disparities in monies awarded based on organizational size and community makeup.
    - *Visualization showing different in funding for large vs. small organizations and how that relates to the percentage of all organizations those budget allocations make up        in the arts and culture ecosystem*
    - *Visualization showing disparities between rural, low-income, and POC demographics compared to amount of grant funding recieved*
- Conclude that, clearly, foundations aren't prioritizing smaller, more diverse organizations, despite their claims to be invested in more DEAI initiatives and equity-based practices.
### Call to Action
- Explain that foundations, as a large source of income for organizations, need to change their practices to be more equitable. Here's what the audience can do:
    1. Learn more about Community Centric Fundraising, which includes ways for organizations to think about taking, or declining, foundation grants to provide more equity and          better outcomes for smaller, BIPOC-led organizations.
    2. Donate your charitable dollars to local, community arts and culture organizations, rather than to multi-million dollar businesses.
- Concluding statement. Something along these lines: "Together, we can make the arts and cultural sector a more equitable, financially sustainable place for all organizations."

## Initial Sketches

## The Data

Because the nonprofit arts and culture sector is so large and is often integrated into economic, social, and other policies, there is a wealth of data from many sources on the topics of philanthropy and foundation support. I have compiled the data source I plan to use in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oufmfe6f4p8LTpYdwsCzqDitpNCOQFGs?usp=sharing). Included are several Excel spreadsheets containing data, as well as reports that synthesize data while also presenting the original dataset in the report appendices. 

The files "AmericansSpeakOutArts_data" and "Giving&Volunteering_data" were taken from the [National Archive of Data on Arts and Culture](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NADAC/index.html), a respository of research datasets that can be used by the public. The "AmericansSpeakOut" dataset provides me with qualitative survey data from a study conducted by [Americans for the Arts](https://www.americansforthearts.org/research) that shows how Americans view the arts and culture sector as well as how they interact with arts and culture in their daily lives. This data will be used as part of my intoduction to showcase how individuals feel towards giving. The "Giving&Volunteering" data, taken from research conducted by [Independent Sector](https://independentsector.org/resources/), will allow me to look at trends in giving, again something that I could use in my intorduction. I'm not sure yet if I will use this data in my final project, so I simply have the data saved. 

My other dataset file comes from [Culture Track](https://culturetrack.com/research/reports/) who conducted research on the overall feeling towards arts and culture created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This data is helpful in highlighting community trends and highlighting data regarding personal giving. This is my other piece of data to use in my introduction, along with the previously mentioned datasets. 

The PDF documents all provide data findings on the main issue of my project, which is foundational funding and funding disparities. The *GIA Reader Report* pulls in data from 2018 and 2020 regarding foundational giving to arts and cultural organizations. The date presented shows how much was given, what types of funding it provided, the top grantmaking organizations in the U.S., and the trends in foundation giving. This information will be used to make the case for foundations providing large amounts of money to arts and culture, which contrasts with the average amount given to low-income, often BIPOC-led, organizations. The *Diversity in the Arts* report from the Devos Insitute of Arts Management at The University of Maryland, presents data on the 25 largest mainstream and 25 largest BIPOC-led organizations in dance, theatre, and museum spaces. I will use this data to convince the audience that disparities do exist in the funding of these organizations, and that it is seen across all types of art in the nonprofit arts and culture sector. Finally, I will be using data presented in the *Note Just Money* report from Helicon Collaborative to make the case that funding disparities also exist along socioeconomic and community lines, disproportionately benefitting large and suburban organizations.

In some cases, I will be using the Excel datasets to create visualizations. In other situations, I will need to create my own spreadsheets based on PDF documents in order to create visualizations. Overall, I think these sources provide robust data that will allow me to create meaningful visualizations to aid in creating an effective presentation. 

## Medium and Method

For my final, I plan on utilizing Shorthand to creat my presentation. After seeing the examples in class, I believe that this will be the perfect platform to build an engaging, clear, and professional product that can showcase my visualizations while also providing other methods of visual interest. Since my project and research revolve around the arts, it needs to be a visually engaging presentation, along with showcasing the visualizations I create. The option of having scrolling images is really appealing to me and adds to the visual interest that I want to create. 

In approaching this process, I plan to complete my project in three basic steps: 1. Create all of my visualizations, utilizing the datasets that I discuss in detail above, 2. Choose imagery to be used in the background of my Shorthand presentation that will help emphasize my main ideas, and 3. Write out the text portions of my presentation, keeping in mind to not over utilize text when it isn't necessary. I tend to write more than necessary and have to edit ruthlessly. Having the visualizations and imagery first will help keep me focused in my writing and it will be easier to see where I do and don't need to include extra text. This process will also help as I like to work on projects in pieces, rather than all at once. Currently, I have a detailed outline of what I want to include, so being able to knock out the hard task of creating the visualizations in my head on my computer can happen first and alleviate my own stress. After that, it will be much easier to piece the rest of the project together.
