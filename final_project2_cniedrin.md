# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboard

I decided to utilize this Part II final project assignment to create a very rough draft of my final project in Shorthand. This helped me sketch out the final layout, play around with some initial images, and import all of the visualizations I have created so far. The text and images presented are by no means complete and will be edited as part of my final project work for Part III.

## User Research

### Research Protocol
In creating my user research protocol, I considered the following factors; target audience, approach to identifying interviewees, questions for the interview, findings from my interviews, and changes I plan on implementing for my final project deliverable. Each factor is discussed thoroughly below. 

**a. Target Audience**

The target audience for this presentation is two-fold. First, the target is current arts administrators who work in philanthropy, either as fundraisers or funders. Specifically, it is geared towards those who already have solid amounts of contributed income and need to think more critically about the privilege that affords them and how they could proceed utilizing more equitable funding mechanisms. 

The second target audience is everyday donors to arts organizations, including adults who are financially stable enough to consider giving to charity regularly as part of their financial practices. As a potential donor myself, it seems logical to donate to larger organizations that I like and want to support. While there is nothing wrong with this, I have the intention, through this presentation, to persuade donors to consider giving their charitable support to marginalized and community-focused organizations that do not get the same hype as large, multi-million dollar enterprises. 

Targeting these two audiences seems to most likely approach to affect real change for philanthropy in the arts and culture sector. 

**b. Identifying Interviewees**

My approach in identifying interviewees is to find people whose opinions I trust as far as giving me feedback, and also people who are somewhat representative of the audience I seek to reach. This might include potential donors like my family or close friends, who could speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to make them consider learning more and donating to smaller, community organizations. I might also solicit the advice of friends in my Arts Management cohort who know something about arts and culture philanthropy who can speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to change the practices of current organizations. This way, I am reasonably accessing both target audiences, while still getting opinions from people who I know will give me valid feedback and suggestions. 

**c. Questions for the Interviews**

For the interviews, I wanted to make sure that I was getting the most useful information back from my interviewees. To do that, I created a list of goals that I wanted to achieve with this project and then created questions that I felt would help me understand whether I was reaching those intended goals or not. Then during the feedback sessions, the interviewee would be shown the presentation draft and asked each question to determine their thoughts and reactions to the overall flow of information and quality of visualizations. 

The following table details the goals and interview questions.

| Goals | Questions |
| ----- | --------- |
|Story effectively conveys main ideas to the audience | What do you see as the main ideas of this presentation? |
| Create a clear flow of information | Did you find the presentation clear? Why or why not? |
| Visualizations are clear, understandable, and enhance the story | What did you think of the visualizations in this presentation? |
| Persuade the audience to learn more or potentially change giving behavior | What about this presentation did you find the most persuasive? What elements could have persuaded you more, if anything? |
| Receive constructive criticism | What else did you like or dislike about this presentation? What, if anything, would you change? |

**d. Interview Findings**

The following chart details the results of my interviews.

| Visualizations are clear, understandable, and enhance the story           | What did you think of the visualizations in this presentation?                                                           | \- Museum, dance, theatre organization visualization needs to be clearer. What is the direct comparison? Give some more context.<br><br>\- I like the square graphs. They're easier to understand than a pie chart. Nesting the rectangles is a good way for me to understand the comparisons and I see it in the news a lot and it helps.<br><br>\- Funding by budget size visualization - takes a while to understand. Add percentage labels in the bars. Rather than "expected" maybe put "If things were equitable..." and then have "reality."<br><br>\- Community percentages - are they supposed to add up to 100%? They're almost 100%. Maybe make it clearer that they are separate demographics that people could fit into multiple categories so they are distinct from one another. Stacked 100% bar charts might show that better. | \- Overall, some more thought about labels and titles - need to be more clear<br><br>\- Choice of charts was good and really pulled out the ideas that you wanted to make.<br><br>\- Drawn chart needs to be simplified so it's just the two data points (not the top 25 funders) to reduce confusion. It's also probably better as a unit chart.<br><br>\- Rather than the expected/reality toggle, maybe just make two separate charts next to each other.<br><br>\- Liked consistency of visualizations. They're all pretty simple and they go together color-wise.<br><br>\- Fix final chart with percentages to make it more clear. What do you mean with the total population vs arts funding? What is "rural" 20% of? | \- I think they're great! Display the content in a visual way.<br><br>\- I don't see any need to improve them in general. They convey the information in a way that allowed me to understand all of the content in a quick, easily understood way.<br><br>\- I thought all the labels and titling were clear and I didn't have questions about the visualizations themselves.<br><br>\- I did have a bit of trouble with the hand drawn one.<br><br>\- I really liked the expected vs reality graph. It had a "shock" factor of some kind.<br><br>\- Out of context, the visualizations wouldn't make sense because you're doing a good job of leading up the visualizations of what you're talking about in the sentence before. Maybe edit the titles/subtitles to make it really clear if the visualizations had to stand alone. Within context, they make perfect sense. |

Based on this feedback, I learned that there were a few categories in which my feedback fell:

- Titles and Labels of charts to provide context
- Connection of information between sections
- Clear connection for Call to Action

My third interviewee was a bit of an outlier in that he found the visualizations more clear than interviewees 1 and 2. This is interesting to note and reinforces the importance of the user research stage; I now know that I need to change certain things like labeling and titles a bit for one audience, but I don't need to make such large changes that audiences like interviewee three are confused. I'm taking away from this exercise the necessity of balance in receiving this kind of feedback. Everyone experiences visualizations and information in different ways, so it is our job as designers to speak to as many of their different styles as possible. This will be one of my challenges, find that balance, as I move onto the final stage of this project. 

Overall, I learned that the presentation had strengths as far as the flow of information, chart choice, and overall messaging. However, with the aforementioned categories of weaknesses in mind, I am now considering how to make changes for my final project.

**e. Planned Changes to Implement**

There are several things I want to change based on the feedback I received from my interviewees. As seen in the above responses, some common themes kept showing up across all of my interviews and I am prioritizing the following changes.

**1. Rename and Re-label Visualizations to Add Context**

- Overall, I found that my interviewees were happy with the **types** of visualizations that I chose. All three stated that they were clear for the most part and my second interviewee made clear that the chart choice was simple and effective. However, there were issues with **understanding** the charts that I initially created. For example, the line chart showing the differences in contributed revenue across mainstream, African American, and Latino organizations were met with questions like, What are examples of organizations included in this study? Doesn't this just happen because the mainstream organizations are more well-known? This comes down to contextualizing this visualization and providing some helpful information before the visualization, and through changing the title and subtitle, to make the data itself clearer. A second example is a chart showing "expected" vs "reality" proportional funding by organizational budget size. The labels were continually confusing as "percent prevalence in the sector" is admittedly weird wording. These comments tell me that I need to implement some changes regarding the titles and labels for these charts. I also received the feedback to make this visualization two separate charts rather than a toggle, and I am considering that as a direct side-by-side comparison may be more impactful. Finally, I received feedback that my final chart wasn't clear as far as the percentages for each community because they don't add up to 100% and shouldn't because they are separate demographics that may have people that overlap into each category. To remedy this, I plan on changing this visualization to a stacked 100% car chart to make the comparisons more clear. 
- Relatedly, the hand-drawn sketch will become a unit chart and will only show the total dollar amount ($2.9 billion) and the 60% taken up by 2% of all art institutions. My second interviewee pointed out that it is unclear as is, and my project has morphed to focus less specifically on foundation giving and more on contributed income as a whole. Therefore, the data point that is currently "top 25 foundations" will be removed to add clarity to the chart and get rid of unimportant information. It isn't necessary to the story at this point. 

**2. Add Connecting Information Between Sections**

- All of my interviewees said that, as a whole, the flow of information in my presentation is clear but could be improved. My second interviewee suggested adding a sentence, perhaps bolded, that calls out what the next visualization is focusing on. My third interviewee mentioned that the times when I did this in the presentation were very helpful. Therefore, I will be adding some text that serves to highlight what the visualization coming will show as well as create a transition from one section to the next. For example, right now I have a sentence that introduces my first visualization - showing how much of the total amount donated to charity in 2020 went to arts and culture - and it primes the audience while also making clear how I'm moving from the call out statistic to that next visualization. I need to add similar language to the rest of my presentation to help the audience follow along with my ideas more clearly. 

**3. Add More "Actionable" Items to Call to Action**

- My interviewees liked the call to action items but thought they were a little bit too passive. I got a lot of feedback that said it made my interviewees think about things in a new way but didn't necessarily move them to action. Additionally, my second interviewee mentioned, correctly, that Community Centric Fundraising (CCF) is a more organizational strategy to address inequitable funding than it is an action a person could implement. To remedy this, I plan on labeling the actions to denote that learning more about CCF is something organizations can do, and giving to community organizations is something individuals can do. I will also be adding a link to the CCF website as well as trying to find some kind of database that allows individuals to look up nonprofit arts organizations in their communities that they could potentially donate to. I want people to be able to DO something rather than just walk away thinking. 

**4. Edit Formatting and Imagery**

- Finally, although I recognize this wasn't the focus of the storyboarding, I plan on working on the physical formatting of my project, as I am unhappy with the layout at the moment, and all three of my interviewees in some way commented on making some of those changes. I also have some unfinished imagery as I was focused more on getting my visualizations and overall structure laid out and didn't spend much time on images. These elements will help tie my project together and make it more aesthetically pleasing for the audience (and myself). 

After focusing on these changes, I believe my project will be more aesthetically pleasing, will present more clear, understandable visualizations, and will allow audience members to do something actionable afterward.
