# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboard

I decided to utilize this Part II final project assignment to create a very rough draft of my final project in Shorthand. This helped me sketch out the final layout, play around with some initial images, and import all of the visualizations I have created so far.

## User Research

### Research Protocol
In creating my user research protocol, I considered the following factors; target audience, approach to identifying interviewees, questions for the interview, findings from my interviews, and changes I plan on implementing for my final project deliverable. Each factor is discussed thoroughly below. 

**a. Target Audience**

The target audience for this presentation is two-fold. First, the target is current arts administrators who work in philanthropy, either as fundraisers or funders. Specifically, it it geared towards those who already have solid amounts of contributed income and need to think more critically about the privilege that affords them and how they could proceed utilizing more equitable funding mechanisms. 

The second target audience is everyday donors to arts organizations, including mostly adults who are financially stable enough to consider giving to charity regularly as part of their financial practices. As a potential donor myself, it seems logical to donate to larger organizations that I like and want to support. While there is nothing wrong with this, I have the intention, through this presentation, to persude donors to consider giving their charitable support to marginalized and community-focused organizations that do not get the same hype as large, multi-million dollar enterprises. 

Targeting these two audiences seems to most likely approach to affect real change for philanthropy in the arts and culture sector. 

**b. Identifying Interviewees**

My approach in identifying interviewees is to find people whose opinions I trust as far as giving me feedback, and also people who are somewhat representative of the audience I seek to reach. This might include potential donors like my family or close friends, who could speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to make them consider learning more and donating to smaller, communtity organizations. I might also solicit the advice of friends in my Arts Management cohort who know something about arts and culture philanthropy who can speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to change the practices of current organizations. This way, I am accessing both target audiences in a reasonable way, while still getting opinions from people who I know will give me valid feedback and suggestions. 

**c. Questions for the Interviews**

For the interviews, I wanted to make sure that I was getting the most useful information back from my interviewees. In order to do that, I created a list of goals that I wanted to acheive with this project, and then created questions that I felt would help me understand whether I was reaching those intended goals or not. Then during the feedback sessions, the interviewee would be shown the presentation draft and asked each question in order to determine their thoughts and reactions to the overall flow of information and quality of visualizations. 

The following table details the goals and interview questions.

| Goals | Questions |
| ----- | --------- |
|Story effectively conveys main ideas to the audience | What do you see as the main ideas of this presentation? |
| Create a clear flow of information | Did you find the presentation clear? Why or why not? |
| Visualizations are clear, understandable, and enhance the story | What did you think of the visualizations in this presentation? |
| Persuade the audience to learn more or potentially change giving behavior | What about this presentation did you find the most persuasive? What elements could have persuaded you more, if anything? |
| Receive constructive criticism | What else did you like or dislike about this presentation? What, if anything, would you change? |

**d. Interview Findings**

**e. Planned Changes to Implement**

There are several things I want to change based on the feedback I recieved from my interviewees. As seen in the above responses, there were some common themes that kept showing up across all of my interviews and I am prioritzing the following changes.

1. Rename and Re-label Visualizations

Overall, I found that my interviewees were happy with the **types** of visualizations that I chose. All three stated that they were clear for the most part and my second interviewee made clear that the chart choice was simple and effective. However, there were issues with **understanding** the charts that I initially created. For example, the line chart showing the differences in contributed revenue across mainstream, African American, and Latino organizations was met with questions like: What are examples of organizations included in this study? Doesn't this just happen because the mainstream organizations are more well-known? This comes down to contextualizing this visualization and providing some helpful information before the visualization, and through changint he title and subtitle, to make the data itself clearer. A second example is the chart showing "expected" vs "reality" proportional funding by organizational budget size. The labels were continually confusing as "percent prevalence in the sector" is admittedly weird wording. These comments tell me that I really need to work on how to clearly present that distinction. I also recieved the feedback to make this visualization two separate charts rather than a toggle, and I am considering that as a direct side-by-side comparison may be more impactful.
