# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboard

I decided to utilize this Part II final project assignment to create a very rough draft of my final project in Shorthand. This helped me sketch out the final layout, play around with some initial images, and import all of the visualizations I have created so far.

## User Research

### Research Protocol
In creating my user research protocol, I considered the following factors; target audience, approach to identifying interviewees, questions for the interview, findings from my interviews, and changes I plan on implementing for my final project deliverable. Each factor is discussed thoroughly below. 

**a. Target Audience**

The target audience for this presentation is two-fold. First, the target is current arts administrators who work in philanthropy, either as fundraisers or funders. Specifically, it it geared towards those who already have solid amounts of contributed income and need to think more critically about the privilege that affords them and how they could proceed utilizing more equitable funding mechanisms. 

The second target audience is everyday donors to arts organizations, including mostly adults who are financially stable enough to consider giving to charity regularly as part of their financial practices. As a potential donor myself, it seems logical to donate to larger organizations that I like and want to support. While there is nothing wrong with this, I have the intention, through this presentation, to persude donors to consider giving their charitable support to marginalized and community-focused organizations that do not get the same hype as large, multi-million dollar enterprises. 

Targeting these two audiences seems to most likely approach to affect real change for philanthropy in the arts and culture sector. 

**b. Identifying Interviewees**

My approach in identifying interviewees is to find people whose opinions I trust as far as giving me feedback, and also people who are somewhat representative of the audience I seek to reach. This might include potential donors like my family or close friends, who could speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to make them consider learning more and donating to smaller, communtity organizations. I might also solicit the advice of friends in my Arts Management cohort who know something about arts and culture philanthropy who can speak to whether my presentation is persuasive enough to change the practices of current organizations. This way, I am accessing both target audiences in a reasonable way, while still getting opinions from people who I know will give me valid feedback and suggestions. 

**c. Questions for the Interviews**
**d. Interview Findings**
**e. Planned Changes to Implement**
