## Project Reflection

Since Part II of my project, I have made significant changes to my finished Shorthand page. Most importantly, I addressed the "Planned Changes to Implement" section and corrected the visualizations to make them more user friendly, per my user research. I also spent a good deal of time working on the aesthetic parts of my presentation, including colors for my visualizations and the additions of imagery from Unsplash.com. The following sections detail specific changes I made with regard to the audience, visualizations, and aesthetic qualities of the presentation. 

### Audience

After working on my initial storyboard, I had the idea that this presentation would be for arts administrators working in philanthropy who could help to change the inequitable practices I set out to highlight throughout the project, as well as individual donors who could choose to make donations to smaller, community organizations. After doing my user research, I don't think this audience has changed much. Overall, I made sure that it was written simply enough that an audience of non-professionals could understand the implications, while still providing enough information that a fundraiser could use it to inform institutional change regarding philanthropy. In order to address both of these audiences, I simplified the language overall and I added connecting sections that made it clear what the next visualization was going to show. This makes the visualizations more understandable and it also helps with the flow of the overall presentation. 

Another major change was the addition of two more call-out statistic/infographic visualizations. The first one puts into perspective the statement that "2% of all cultural institutions receive almost 60% of all contributed revenue." While this is striking in and of itself, I added more context by finding how many arts and culture organizations are in the U.S. right now and determining how much money really went to how many organizations. I think this specificity can be helpful in driving home the point that these disparities in funding are large. It also makes the overall presentation more persuasive, along with providing some extra context which was requested by my research interviewees. 

### Visualizations

When I recieved feedback on my initial storyboard, the overarching theme from my interviewees was that the visualizations were good in terms of chart choice, but were not as effective in terms of labeling. 

The first two visualizations, the tree map and the pie chart, were easily understood by my interviewees, so the only changes I made were to the colors so that they matched everything else in the presentation. The next visualization, which is just a sketch in the storyboard document, I chose to create in Infogram and made it a "unit chart" utilizing dollar signs as the units to show how much 60% of all funding looked like. This is a much cleaner version than my sketch, which I intitally wanted to include a third variable, but decided to get rid of it as it didn't add to my story based on how my initial idea evolved. After this, I added the infogram call out statistic that, as discussed above, put numbers to the percentages I was stating, to show just how large the disparity really was. I discovered through my interviews that people truly do perceive visualizations in different ways, so for this fact, which is very important to my overall story, I wanted to show it in a variety of ways to make it stick in the minds of my audience members. 

The next two visualizations I changed the colors and the labelling. Both received new, clearer titles and subtitles that are better suited to describe the data that is being shown. I also decided to make those visualizations larger by adding a dedicated HTML block, rather than incorporate them into the text blocks because they were easier to read that way, and I received some feedback from classmates that they weren't able to read those smaller charts clearly. I also added data labels to the "If Funding was Equitable by Budget Size vs. The Reality" chart so that it was easier for audience members to clearly identify the percentage being shown rather than trying to match them up along the labelled x-axis. To me, that seemed more accessible to a wider audience. 

Finally, I changed the final visualization entirely to better show the funding gap between the prevalence of certain communities in the U.S. to the average amount of arts funding recieved. It now clearly shows the large difference between the type of community and funding. I had a lot of trouble coming up with clear labels for this chart and spent a lot of time writing and re-writing them to make sure it would be clear to the audience what I was trying to convey. What I landed on is a much more powerful chart choice and makes it easier than my initial choice of a bar chart to show the comparisons. 

Overall, the feedback I recieved on my visualizations was consistent and detailed enough that I feel confident in the choices I made regarding re-labelling and re-visualizing some of the data. These changes will make it much easier for any audience member to easily determine what message I am trying to convey. 

### Aesthetics

Although I didn't make a specific mood board, I did have in my head an idea of what I wanted the presentation to look like in terms of colors and layout. My initial draft was rough and, to be quite honest, quite ugly. At that point, I hadn't started to flesh out what I wanted the visuals or colors to be and those ideas came to me in the process of getting feedback, editing my visualizations, and adding text to the presentation. 

Because the presentation focuses on money, I utilized green as a recurring color that ties all the visualizations together, as well as the color used in my call-out statistics. Beyond the green, I wanted a dark color palette that utilized blues and blacks to go along with the title image. At the same time, I didn't want to limit myself to only those colors for my imagery, so when I chose images to go with my text, I looked for those with a darker color palette that showed what I wanted and fit in with the overall aesthetic, if not the exact color palette. The only place I really varied this was at the end of my presentation when I get to my "Call to Action" and final statement. I wanted that to be lighter and more colorful thatn the rest of the presentation to show the hope that I have for th esector improving on this issue I've learned so much about. By making these changes, my presentation looks much more put-together than my draft and conveys the serious, and eventually hopeful tone, that I have throughout the course of the presentation.


In conclusion, the changes I made to this presentation were with the feedback from my interviews in mind which represented the two audiences that I wanted to reach: administrators and donors. The final product now incorporates the context necessary to understand the issue, appropriate visualizations to back up my findings, and the aesthetic quality that would make someone want to look at this presentation. I learned a lot throughout this process, and feel more confident that I have a process for the future when approaching data visualization projects.
