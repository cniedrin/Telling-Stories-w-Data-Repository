# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique By Design

## Step 1: Find a Data Visualization

Arguments have been made in recent years for and against liberal arts education. On one hand, some argue that having a liberal arts education improves job marketability as students come away with improved [critical thinking, analytic, and writing skills](https://www.newgeography.com/content/003564-the-value-a-liberal-arts-education-landing-a-job). On the other hand, some have argued that it is more important for universities to offer programs directly related to the needs of the current market. 

This data and visualization, taken from Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce ["Hard Times: College Majors, Unemployment, and Earnings" report](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/hard-times-2012/#resources), argues that different college majors, along with the level of education achieved, are correlated with higher or lower unemployment rates. Some [conclusions](https://www.slideshare.net/CEWGeorgetown/hard-times-college-majors-unemployment-and-earnings-not-all-college-degrees-are-created-equal-54178784) are reached including statements such as, "unemployment is lowest where the ties between majors and occupation are the highest" and "graduate degrees can help boost earning potential."

However, their visualization of this unemployment data could use some work.

I chose this particular visualization for a couple of reasons. First, the content is interesting to me as someone who has spent a great deal of time in education - as a student and as a teacher - and as someone who strongly supports liberal arts education because I believe it creates more well-rounded individuals. Secondly, I think this visualization has some problems, from the lack of clarity, to the color choices, to the decisions about labels. I wanted the opportunity to analyze what it is that I don't like about this visualization and create a new visualization that clearly conveys the data in the way the it was originally intended. 

## Step 2: Critique the Visualization

## Step 3: Wireframe a Solution 

## Step 4: Test the Solution

## Step 5: Build a Solution
